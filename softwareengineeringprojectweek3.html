		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 3</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 5.5 hours.</p>
		
		<p>This week I attended a two hour meeting with most of the group members to go over the last part of the deliverable that 
		are due in Tuesday 26th February. During this meeting I said that I would have a look more into the repo to make sure it was
		up to specification as QA Manager. To do this I spent about half an hour reading through SE.QA.08 to know to add the minutes 
		to the repo and change the layout of some parts of it.</p>
		<p>During the meeting I was also given the task of meeting up with two of my group members and make the user interface online
		presentation which we spent three hours on.</p>
