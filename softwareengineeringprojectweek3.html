		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 3</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 7 hours 30 minutes.</p>

		<p>This week I attended a two hour meeting with most of the group members to go over the last part of the deliverable that 
		are due in Tuesday 26th February. During this meeting I said that I would have a look more into the repo to make sure it was
		up to specification as QA Manager. To do this I spent about 30 minutes reading through SE.QA.08 to know to add the minutes 
		to the repo and change the layout of some parts of it.</p>
		
		<p>During the meeting I was also given the task of meeting up with two of my group members and make the user interface online
		presentation which we spent three hours on.</p>
		
		<p>I also then attended a follow up meeting lasting approximately 1 hour with some of the group to go over the documents and
		the online presentation we made.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, I spent about an hour read through the User Interface document made by the team and ensuring that it followed
		the General Documentation Standards (SE.QA.02) and the User Interface Specification Standards (SE.QA.04) by adding and changing
		paragraphs and making general changes to the format of the document.</p>
