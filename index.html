		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi! I'm Demi, a second year BSc Computer Science student at Aberystwyth University in Wales. I am currently 
		learning and becoming more proficient in Java, HTML and CSS and I am familiar with Python, C++ and the Linux Mint
		Operating System. I am also currently learning how to use Blender in my spare time as I'm interested in computer
		graphics and design and have an Applied Graphics module during the year.</p>
		<p>I'm also part of my university Robotics Society and Outreach Program in which I help students from local schools
		build their skills in robotics.</p>
		<p>In my own time I like playing piano (badly) and reading books (mainly the fantasy genre). I am also an avid TV viewer,
		especially of TV shows like Doctor who and superhero movies.</p>
		<p>I have a vested interest in computer networking, digital forensics and cyber security which are major areas which I would like
		to pursue in the future.</p>
