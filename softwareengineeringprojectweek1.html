		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 1</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 4 hours.</p>
		
		<p>This week was the first official week of the beginning of my group project. During this time, I created these
		pages on my website for the blog so I can record what I did each week and how many hours I spent on the tasks I 
		complete. The link to this was sent to a member of my group so my project manager can find each person's blog easier.</p>
		
		<p>As was asked, I also read through the project requirements and the Group Intro documents to better understand
		what the project was about an what was needed of certain people. Additionally, I read the SE.QA.01 through to SE.QA.05
		documents taking in what was most important to broaden my knowledge on the quality plans and the specified deliverables. 
		Doing this so far has helped me to understand when certain parts of the projects are going to need to be done and by
		who and I plan on reading the rest of the documents in the next week.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, as a group we had a meeting between the hours of 15:00 and 16:00 on Friday 8th February as this was
		the best time that we could all meet as a group around our other responsibilities. In this meeting, we made sure
		everyone was on track with the tasks they were given in the official group meeting with the project manager and talked
		about what roles people wanted to take on. I, for example, said I wouldn't mind being the QA Manager so I can make sure
		everything is up to standards and what we produce is what the client wants.</p>
