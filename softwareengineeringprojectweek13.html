		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 13</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 17 hours 30 minutes.</p>
		
		<p>During work week I met with most of the group every day mostly going through the documents and Java code and 
		giving tasks to the others if they had time outside of coding as well as adding what I could myself such as copywirte
		 and Java Docs to the code and ensuring there were no spelling mistakes in the documentaiton as well as other things.</p>
		
		<p>I also walked around town and helped to take pictures of pubs for the metadata.</p>
		
		<p>As well as this I attempted to download Androd Studio to help with coding however there was trouble with 
		opening the project so I was not able to do this.</p>
		
		<p>After work week I went though all the documentation including the final reports and delegated tasks to people 
		if parts had been left out.</p>
