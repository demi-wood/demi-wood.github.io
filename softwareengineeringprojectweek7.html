		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 7</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 4 hours.</p>
		
		<p>Total hours of work so far: Approximately 27 hours 45 minutes.</p>
		
		<p>During week 7 of the project I spent an hour and a half creating a skeleton for the Design Document ensuring is was up to the
		specifications of the General Documentation standards (SE.QA.02) and the Design Specification Standards (SE.QA.05). This was
		done because it made work for the rest of my group easier as all they have to do is paste content in.</p>
		
		<p>I also spent half an hour going through the UI Presentation and making some small changes to it so it followed the feedback
		that was given to us. I also asked people in the group to change some details of the parts they did as well.</p>
		
		<p>During the meetings of this week we split the work that was needed to be done for the Design Document.</p>
