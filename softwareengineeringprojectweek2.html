		<h2>CS22120: Software Engineering Group Project Week 2</h2>

		<p>Hours of work: Approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.</p>
		
		<p>This week I attended two group sessions on Friday and Monday to catch everyone up on the progress that had been made
		during the week. We looked at the UI diagrams and it seems that both the desktop and mobile application designs are in
		the final stages of completion. We also looked at the testing that had been done by other members of the group and with
		some discussion apporived most of the document.</p>
		
		<p>My task this week was to look more into the typical users for the application in which I wrote the paragraphs for the
		document.</p>
